=== Building the Site for Local Preview

This repository includes a Gradle build script that you can use to build the documentation site for local preview.
The script automates all aspects of the build.
All you need on your machine to execute the build is a Java Development Kit (aka java and javac).

Begin by cloning the documentation repository:

 $ git clone git@github.com:mulesoft/mulesoft-docs.git

[TIP]
====
If you're not interested in the entire history, and you want to reduce the size of the clone, add the `--depth` flag to execute a shallow clone:

 $ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:mulesoft/mulesoft-docs.git
====

Next, switch to the directory into which you cloned the repository:

 $ cd mulesoft-docs

Finally, use the `gradlew` command to launch Gradle and execute the site builder:

 $ ./gradlew

Running `gradlew` with no arguments executes the default task, which is named build.
It's equivalent to the following:

 $ ./gradlew build

(The build task may take several minutes to complete).

Once you've built the site, you can once again use Gradle to serve the site using a local, in-memory web server:

 $ ./gradlew serve

You can now access the site from your browser at the location \http://localhost:8000.

CAUTION: Currently, not all links work in the local preview since the preview server doesn't implement the rewrite rules used in production.
If you encounter a 404 when clicking on a link in the site navigation, try adding ".html" to the URL in the location bar.

When you want to stop the preview server, simply press kbd:[Ctrl+c].

To run a full build and launch the preview server in one shot, combine the `build` and `serve` tasks:

 $ ./gradlew build serve

=== Building the Site for Stating

The Gradle build script is also capable of building the site for stating and syncing the output to the staging server.
The extra tasks and configuration needed for these operations are added when the `profile` property has the value `stating`.
You can set this property by passing the flag `-Pprofile=stating` to the `gradlew` launch command.

To instruct Gradle to clean, build, and publish the stating site, execute the following command:

 $ ./gradlew clean publish -Pprofile=staging

NOTE: The staging site combines the assets from the staging branch of mule-docs-site-assets with the content from the master branch of mule-docs.

=== Building the Site for Production

The Gradle build script is also capable of building the site for production and publishing it to git.
The extra tasks and configuration needed for these operations are added when the `profile` property has the value `prod`.
You can set this property by passing the flag `-Pprofile=prod` to the `gradlew` launch command.

To instruct Gradle to clean, build, and publish the production site, execute the following command:

 $ ./gradlew clean publish -Pprofile=prod

CAUTION: The first time you execute this command, it will run for a very long time (depending on connection speed) since it must clone the publish (aka build output) repository anew.

WARNING: The publish task doesn't yet push the new commit to the remote repository.

== MuleSoft Docs Style Guide

The following sections describe the MuleSoft Docs publishing style.

=== Content

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Style |Correct Example |Incorrect Example
|Use active text instead of "will", "you'll", "won't", or "we'll". |This feature initializes and merges your code. |This feature will initialize and merge your code.
|Obfuscate login credentials in illustrations and code |The client secret is 4242424242424242-ABADDOG |My password is foobar123
|Only use RFC-1918 IP addresses for example IPv4 addresses: +
10.0.0.0  - 10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix) +
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix) +
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
|Set the server address to 10.1.1.42 |For example, set the address to 42.42.42.42.
|Use the example.com domain |For example, mydomain@example.com |myname@mycompany.com
|Omit "please" |Contact MuleSoft Customer Support. |Please contact MuleSoft Customer Support.
|Separate options with > and don't cast the > in bold |*File* > *New* > *Mule Project* | *File -> New -> Mule Project*
|Replace "in order to" with "to" |To start the procedure, |In order to start the procedure
|Omit "then" |Click this and that |Click this, and then click that
|Don't use "select" if you mean click. Select only highlights text. Click activates a link or button. |Click *OK*. |Select *OK*.
|Omit button ellipses |Click *Test Connections*. |Click *Test Connections...*.
|Omit "on" with click |Click *Test Connections*. |Click on *Test Connections*.
|Init-cap words in headings |Default Value Setting |Default value setting
|Spell out i.e. and e.g. |Create a connector, for example, for Salesforce |Create a connector, e.g. for Salesforce
|Don't put code examples in a screenshot |Put code in a source block |screenshot
|Put a period outside a quote string |Don't say "will". |Don't say "will."
|Use the Oxford comma |a, b, and c |a, b and c
|Omit the trademark symbol |Anypoint Platform |Anypoint™ Platform™
|===

=== AsciiDoc Conventions

* `[source]` is better than `[source,code]`.
* Better to use "a" columns in tables such as cols="30a,70a".
* Omit `linenums` option on 1 line code examples.
* Put multi-word examples in a source block instead of a long tick marked string.
* Tab names should be "Visual Studio Editor" and "XML Editor or Standalone".
* Only XML or XML procedures can be in an XML tab. It's illogical to put a screenshot in the XML tab.
* Restrict tables to 2 or 3 columns - multi-column tables can be very difficult to read.
* Wrap code example lines at spaces, or for Java after a dot. Code lines should be less than 60 characters, especially if you use the \//<n> notation for callouts
* Until Coderay fixes the spacing for line numbers, don't reference code examples by line numbers. Instead usee \//<1> in the code example and reference the notation in the text below the code example.

=== Lists

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Rule |Description |Example
|Imperative before lists |Before starting a list, provide a starting sentence that starts with "to" 
that describes the task you want people to provide. Also, don't start a bullet or numbered list after a heading without a starting sentence. |To set the values:
|Insert a period at the end of a sentence or bullet list item |Perform these tasks. |Perform these tasks
|Start each item in a bullet list or numbered list with a capital letter |Start list items that are not reserved words with an init cap
|* Ensure all required fields are set.
|Start number list items with an action |Number list items only start with an action such as Click, Set, etc. |1. Click the plus
sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
|===

=== Font Changes

[cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Font |Description |Example
|Bold |A button or field name |Click *Test Connections*.
|`tick marks` |Reserved words or code examples, such as a MEL expression |`#[payload]`
|Italics |Emphasis |_Ensure the checkbox is set_
|Bold italics |Mule Enterprise license requirements. |*_Enterprise_*
|Bold links |Important links like Skip to Code | \*\<\<Skip to Code>>*
|Quotes |Displayed items
|===

=== Headings

* No special characters in headings
* Init-cap each word in a heading
* Don't put a colon at the end of a heading
* Ensure headings are in order, h1 > h2 > h3 > h4. Don't skip levels such as h2 > h5
* Only one H1 per doc at the top of the file
* Don't number headings

=== Word Choices

* JSON not Json
* POJO not pojo or Pojo
* MOJO not mojo or Mojo
* ID not id or Id
* Anypoint Studio not Mule Studio

Don't spell out common acronyms such as POJO, JSON, MOJO, REST, SOAP, MQ, UI, IT, IP, TCP/IP
